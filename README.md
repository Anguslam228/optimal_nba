Objective:
The game of basketball has been around for centuries, initially created as a fun alternative to boring physical education classes. Throwing a ball into a peach basket in the late 1800s had no particular meaning whatsoever, but over the course of its existence, basketball has become one of the most popular sports worldwide. As the game slowly evolved from stationary shooting around the basket to rapid-fire shots from the three-point line, the optimal players started to look and play in many different ways. As an avid fan of the sport, I was intrigued by the vast amount of data that can be collected with today’s advanced technology, and wanted to try to take a glimpse at which player archetype is the most important in today’s game. Inspired by findings from Muthu Alagappan’s 2012 project From 5 to 13: Redefining the Positions in Basketball, I’ll be studying how today’s game has evolved both physically and statistically.
